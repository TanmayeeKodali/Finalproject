# Introduction

This analysis examines the temporal patterns of SARS-CoV-2 variant emergence and dominance in the United States from December 2022 through October 2024. We focus on variants that achieved significant prevalence (>5%), representing successive waves of viral evolution and replacement.

**Key Research Questions:**
1. How quickly did dominant variants emerge and decline?
2. What were the peak prevalence levels for each variant?
3. How do replacement dynamics compare across different variant families?

# Methods

## Data Source
Data from CDC's SARS-CoV-2 Variant Proportions dataset (https://data.cdc.gov/Laboratory-Surveillance/SARS-CoV-2-Variant-Proportions/jr58-6ysp)

## Variant Selection Criteria
- Variants that achieved >5% national prevalence
- Time period: December 2022 - October 2024
- Geographic scope: United States (national level)

## Data Processing

```{r load-processed-data}
# Load pre-processed data
var_USA <- readRDS("../output/processed_data.rds")

# Display dataset info
cat("Analyzed dataset:", nrow(var_USA), "rows\n")
cat("Time range:", as.character(min(var_USA$week)), "to", 
    as.character(max(var_USA$week)), "\n")
cat("Number of unique variants:", n_distinct(var_USA$variant), "\n")
```

**Variants analyzed:** XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, EG.5, HV.1, JN.1, KP.2, KP.3, KP.3.1.1

### Interpretation

The summary statistics analysis reveals that true variant dominance patterns with XBB lineages and JN.1 achieving the highest peaks at 90.2% and 96.4% respectively, demonstrating clear epidemic waves. XBB lineages emerged most rapidly (5.64%/week) reaching 90% dominance in just 15 weeks (December 2022 to March 2023) but declined slowly over 62 weeks (March 2023 to May 2024), while JN.1 showed similarly fast emergence (5.07%/week over 18 weeks from October 2023 to February 2024) with moderate 36-week decline. 

EG.5 and HV.1 remained sub-dominant with peaks around 25% in September and November 2023 respectively, exhibiting slower emergence rates (0.98-1.40%/week over 22-24 weeks), while the FLiRT variants showed an unusual pattern of slow 32-week emergence (February to September 2024) but extremely rapid 4-week decline (11.74%/week through October 2024), suggesting aggressive displacement by subsequent variants. The "Weeks >30%" metric confirms XBB (347 weeks cumulative across variants) and JN.1 (243 weeks) as truly dominant, while others achieved only brief or no dominance periods.

```{r overlap-analysis}
# Load overlap analysis
overlap_analysis <- readRDS("../output/tables/overlap_analysis.rds")

cat("\nWeeks with multiple variants >5%:", 
    sum(overlap_analysis$n_variants > 1), "\n")
cat("Maximum concurrent variants:", 
    max(overlap_analysis$n_variants), "\n")
```

```{r variant-trends-figure, fig.cap="Temporal trends of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the USA showing sequential replacement dynamics"}
# Load and display the pre-generated figure
knitr::include_graphics("../output/figures/variant_trends.png")
```

### Interpretation

The temporal trends clearly illustrate sequential variant replacement dynamics with minimal overlap between dominant strains. XBB.1.5 dominated early 2023, followed by a brief competition period where EG.5 and HV.1 co-circulated at moderate levels without achieving dominance, before JN.1 swept through in early 2024 reaching near-complete prevalence. 

The FLiRT variants (KP.2, KP.3, KP.3.1.1) show staggered emergence in mid-2024 with KP.3.1.1 rising as others decline, demonstrating within-family competition. The overlap analysis confirms relatively clean succession with only 38 weeks showing multiple variants >5% and maximum 4 concurrent variants, indicating that despite co-circulation periods, dominant variants typically achieved near-monopoly prevalence rather than stable coexistence.
